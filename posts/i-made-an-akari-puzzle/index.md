I made an Akari puzzle, hosted on [dailyakari.com](https://dailyakari.com/)!

To the internet people who found me through the link on the puzzle, thank you
for playing! I'm not very active on social media, so I'll post it here instead.
This blog site is so dusty but I might revive it a bit.

For those who don't know what is Akari, go play it. It is good!

That is for now. Just want to share a small moment of joy. Bye!
